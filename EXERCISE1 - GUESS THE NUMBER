#Q - CHOOSE ANY NUMBER AND ASSIGN IT TO A VARIABLE. USER HAVE TO GUESS THIS NUMBER.
#    YOU ALSO HAVE TO PRINT INCREASE THE NUMBER IF NUMBER IS SMALLER AND DECREASE THE NUMBER IF IT IS GREATER.
#    THERE SHOULD BE ONLY 10 NO.OF GUESSES
#    YOU HAVE TO PRINT NO OF GUESSES LEFT
#    YOU HAVE TO PRINT NO OF GUESSES USER TAKES
#    IF GUESSES ARE OVER YOU HAVE TO PRINT GAME OVER

# SOLUTION:-
import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
guesses = 1
print("GUESS THE NUMBER GAME")
print("GUESS THE NUMBER BETWEEN 1-100\n")
print("YOU HAVE 10 CHANCES TO GUESS THE CORRECT NUMBER")
while guesses<=10:
    try:
        a = int(input("GUESS THE NUMBER: "))
    except Exception as e:
        print("WRONG INPUT")
        break
    if a<number:
        print("YOUR NUMBER IS TOO LOW! INCREASE THE NUMBER")
    elif a>number:
        print("YOUR NUMBER IS TO HIGH! DECREASE THE NUMBER")
    else:
        print("\nYOU WON!\nYOU TOOK", guesses, "CHANCES TO WIN")
        break
    print("NUMBER OF GUESSES LEFT:", 10 - guesses)
    guesses = guesses + 1
if guesses>10:
    print("YOU LOST!\nTHE CORRECT NUMBER IS", number)

input("GAME OVER, PRESS ENTER TO EXIT")
